Module 1 - Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends
# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to help Louise meet her crowdfunding campaign goal to fund her play, Fever, by identifying any trends in successful funding campaigns in relation to their launch dates and funding goals from data collected from almost 4,000 theater campaigns. With a budget estimated of over $10,000, this analysis aims to help Louise mimic other successful campaigns to meet her goal. 

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
A pivot table was generated, and a line graph created to display the total number of outcomes based on the month that the campaigns were launched. As seen in the chart below, May had the highest number of successful theater campaigns launched, whereas December had the lowest number of successful campaigns.
